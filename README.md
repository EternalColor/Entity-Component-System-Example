# Entity-Component-System-Example

This is a example game done completly in the new Unity Entity Component System. 
The game has systems for pathfinding, enemy finite state machine, collisions (with new Unity Physics), input, inventory, weapon animation (by using slerp and lerp).

I removed all assets except for the scripts that were used in this project, 
since the meshes ive originaly used in this project might be protected by copyright. 
The meshes that are shown in the screenshot (weapon and shield) were done by me.
